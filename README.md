# GAN in stock prediction pytorch
This repo is a experiment I made to test whether GAN can work in stock prediction. Recently, I saw a few paper in using GAN to enhance the prediction. However, all of them do not open the source code, so I decided to build on my own. The result of this repo may not as good as the paper, but it seems if we adjust the model more carefully or use some training tips, which likes changing activation, adding gularization, using WGAN or other structure. GAN might have a chance to predict well, and we might also use diffusion model either!!
